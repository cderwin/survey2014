						<div class='col-md-6'>
							<p>For the first time ever, <i>The Circle Voice</i> has launched an extensive survey of the student body at Groton — online! The survey’s 50 questions
							cover a variety of topics both often discussed and seldom mentioned, ranging from grade inflation and hook-up culture to self-harm and sleep
							deprivation.</p>
							
							<p>As we have promised, presented here are all of your answers as fully disclosed as anonymity concerns would allow.  Please keep in mind that though
							we did our best, some questions may not have been
							optimally worded and this is not a scientific survey.  The results are divided into six sub-sections: General Information,
							Academics, Residential Life, Diversity, and Sex and Drugs &amp; Wellness.</p>
						</div>
							
						<div class='col-md-6'>
							<p>Through the hard numbers, we hope to present the collective experiences and opinions
							that define life on the Circle in the most objective and informative way possible.</p>
						
							<p>The online medium allows for a more in-depth presentation of results than the print edition, and we encourage you to explore the results through these
							interactive graphs. </p>
							
							<p>We received an incredible number of honest, thoughtful comments, and you can read some of them under Comments. The discussion doesn’t stop there: feel
							free to provide any additional thoughts and feedback under the <a href='#discussion'>Discussion</a> section.</p>

				<p>From III Form to VI Form, the number of credits of credits taken decreases each year.  The average time spent on homework per night is 2.7 hours, and we see
				a drastic increase from IV Form to V Form.  Evidently, Senior Spring is as rumored.  Science, History, English, and Classics are the most time-intensive
				departments, while Math and Foreign Language are evidently less so.</p>

				<p>Females have a higher GPA than males overall, though they do have every student who reported having below an 80.  By race, Asians typically outperformed their white and black counterparts,
				and other races were omitted due to concerns of anonymity and insufficient data.</p>
				
				<div id='q13' class='chart'></div>
				
				<p>Though there were  more responses asserting that Groton had deflated grades than inflated grades, over 50% of respondents were neutral, perhaps indicating

				<p>In general, there are more students who agree with Groton’s academic requirements than those who do not. The one notable exception is ethics: though the
				majority of students in the Vth form and below believe ethics to be a necessary curricular element, 52% of VIth formers, the only students who have taken
				Ethics, either “Disagree” or “Strongly Disagree.” This may suggest that the Ethics curriculum as it exists may need examination in order not to disappoint
				so many VIth formers.</p>

				<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, those with lower grades reported a greater disparity in perceived grading fairness, and likewise those with higher grades
				perceived those grades to be more fair.  Interestingly, the three departments in which students reported investing the most time were also those reported
				as the least likely to reflect that effort in grades.</p>

				<p>The vast majority of Grotonians are happy at Groton, with only 12% of respondents saying that they are unhappy.  Additionally, happiness increases by form
				until happiness peaks at V form, before decreasing in student's final year at Groton.  Almost three-quarters of us would choose to come to Groton if we were to
				do it again, and only 7.8% would decline to return.</p>

				<p>34% of Caucasians and 43% of Asians agree or strongly agree that there is racism on campus, compared to 63% of Hispanics and 65% of Blacks.</p>
				
				<p>A far more drastic distinction exists for the opinion on sexism. Only 43% of male students agree that sexism exists on campus, while that same
				statistic is a staggering 90% for girls.  
				
				<p>For homophobia, a similar pattern presents itself: though more students agree than disagree that it exists on campus, that opinion is
				far stronger among those closest to the issue. 86% of the LGBTQ community at Groton, 32 students, agreed, while only 2 students disagreed.</p>
				
				<div id='q37' class='chart'></div>

				have decided that they are homosexual or bisexual.</p>
				
				<div id='q36' class='chart'></div>
				
				<p>This is the first year of the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force’s existence, so some leeway must be afforded to them regarding the number of students
				who think they haven’t affected campus life. However, among boys, more responded “negative” than “positive” by a small margin, an interesting result. This
				will be a question to keep an eye on in future years, as the task force becomes more established on campus.</p>

				Notably, relationships in VI form tends to become more steady as the number of 1 relationship increases.</p>

				<p>After the age of consent, the incidences of sexual intercourse and oral sex increase dramatically both on and off campus. An overwhelming majority of males
				have watched porn, while slightly less than 20% of females have. A significant gap exists between Lower School and Upper School males, possibly due to dorm
				structure. Meanwhile, females tend to watch more porn as they rise in form.</p>

							<li><p><i>"I really like the idea behind the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force but the inclusion thing is getting out of hand to
							the point where our traditions are no longer in place and lower schoolers are rude to the upper schoolers."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"I feel that Groton is a place that is supportive for coming out, but there are certain individuals who would hinder
							that process."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"It makes too big a deal of people coming out, so people don't want to come out and have that be their only identifying trait."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"The DITF is ineffective, and cannot be effective. The methods they currently employ do not fix the problems they seek to fix, and the
						methods that would fix those problems would cause even more."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"At any given place there are going to be people that have opinions that negatively affect certain people, and the school is punishing
						people for their opinions instead of trying to show them the reasons to be inclusive."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"Though I believe there is absolutely support and a general feeling of tolerance at Groton, I've also witnessed the difference between
						tolerance and acceptance. Personally, I surely wouldn't want to be merely "tolerated" for anything that compromises who I am as a whole.
						The actively homophobic demographic of this school is definitely in the minority, however their voices are at times louder than the more 
						tolerant individuals. I think it would be worth looking into micro-aggressions as a vehicle for discrimination that may not be as forthright
						as straight up expressions of prejudice."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"Groton is one of the most homophobic enviroments [sic] I have ever been in."</i></p></li>

						that is plaguing this school and nation."</i></p></li>

							<li><p><i>"Maybe a question about how well we think groton provides help for people who are depressed, eating disorders, etc. My experience with
							getting help was not very good. I got all sorts of medications thrown at me without any real investigation into the problem."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"Academics here are amazing, maybe the stress level could be toned down a bit. Athletics need to be taken more seriously too. With a school
						of such high standards why cant we be both academically and athletically superb."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"Seems impossible for people to have fun without insulting or "chirping" other, which ruins the social experience here."</i></p></li>
 
							<li><p><i>"Atheists should have a structured philosophical discussion group instead of blindly picking a service and wasting an hour pretending to pay
							attention and pray. The only time I have felt excluded and uncomfortable at this school is every morning when I'm hear a prayer for a Christian
							god and a Christian god only and when a hymn like On Ward Christian Solider is sung."</i></p></li>
